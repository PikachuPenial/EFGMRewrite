- attachments sometimes do not persist when item is dropped, but do persist when moved between containers/inventories
    it seems to happen when you only equip a sight (and potentially only equipping one other type of attachment), not going to be a proiority
    because it only affects items manually dropped and items stashed and then equipped (and same with items from death bags) still work properly

- ammo does not properly deflow from the inventory, effectively duping ammunition when multiple stacks are involved

- lua errors that can be ignored when receiving items before a user enters their inventory
