Features that sound cool and are doable idk

    Separate day and night maps

- self explanatory
- every 1 or maybe 2 matches, time gets switched (go from playing on day maps to night maps or vice versa)

    Achievement system (tasks but not)

- Achievements won't reset with wipes
- Each achievement will have conditions and a reward, such as a player model, scoreboard cosmetic (idk yet), or achievement-only gun unlock
- Achievement conditions will match its reward (like cqb kills for a shotgun, long kills for a sniper, etc)
- The idea is that you can complete these at your own pace, as unlike tasks they wouldnt be required for progression, or just 100% them if you want idk
- If I ever get around to doing this, I might call the gun unlocks something else like "contracts" or something

    New map to replace efgm_belmont

- I just got this idea earlier and idk it sounds cool and wanna write it down
- Set in a military facility inside of and across a ravine inside a snowy mountain
- The facility would get power via a hydroelectric dam, that runs off of water flowing down the ravine
- The facility would be roughly belmont sized (as far as like walkable space) with 2-3 levels, varying from claustrophobic hallways located inside the mountain to catwalks going across and parallel to the river
- Would be a few places of interest, like a shooting range, power station, military storage, civilian housing and cafeterias and shit, maybe even a helipad on top of the facility

    Shitty skill idea

- OG skills were kinda dogshit (they worked mostly in the background, they didn't do much, most players probably didnt pay attention to them)
- I've been playing way too much fucking disco elysium so that might influence this

- So basically instead of skills, you got one or two slots each corresponding to general gameplay elements (combat, movement, maybe one
related to loot / buying / selling / stashing)
- These slots begin locked, but every 5-10 levels you get a point to unlock a specific slot in a specific category
- As you play the game, doing ___ thing ___ amount of times will unlock different "skills" to put into slots
- Each skill will belong to a specific category, and it show you a name, description, temporary bonus / debuff, and a requirement to complete
- When you put a skill into a slot, that temporary effect instantly applies, and you're stuck with it until you either remove the skill,
which will reset progress on it, or until you complete the requirement (e.g get 20 pmc kills)
- When you complete the requirement, the description updates, and the effect is replaced with new effect(s)
- The new effect(s) are not shown to the player until they complete the requirement of the skill, making the system a kind of gamble that
isn't necessary to progress, but fun and rewarding to play around with
- If you don't like the skill's permanent effect, you can remove it using up a slot point
- Literally just the DE thought cabinet

    Reworked raid xp calculation

- The server keeps track of player's xp and money they accumulate in the raid (from looting, kills, etc) and doesn't give it to them instantly
- Different ways of leaving affects the amount of xp and money you get
- Like using an extract could give you 100% of xp and money, but dying might only give you 50%
- Maybe different extracts could multiply it more, like 120% for a non-guranteed extract or something
