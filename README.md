# Escape From Garry's Mod

A heavily work in progress [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/) gamemode, the sequel to the original Escape From Garry's Mod, relatively unpolished and missing many gameplay mechanics and elements, do not play if you don't know what you are doing

portanator and I (penial) have been working on this gamemode on and off for two years and neither of us can promise that it'll ever be complete, just working on it when we are bored and not busy, it's not our job
