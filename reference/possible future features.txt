Features that sound cool and are doable idk

    Separate day and night maps

- self explanatory
- every 1 or maybe 2 matches, time gets switched (go from playing on day maps to night maps or vice versa)

    Achievement system (tasks but not)

- Achievements won't reset with wipes
- Each achievement will have conditions and a reward, such as a player model, scoreboard cosmetic (idk yet), or achievement-only gun unlock
- Achievement conditions will match its reward (like cqb kills for a shotgun, long kills for a sniper, etc)
- The idea is that you can complete these at your own pace, as unlike tasks they wouldnt be required for progression, or just 100% them if you want idk
- If I ever get around to doing this, I might call the gun unlocks something else like "contracts" or something

    New map to replace efgm_belmont

- I just got this idea earlier and idk it sounds cool and wanna write it down
- Set in a military facility inside of and across a ravine inside a snowy mountain
- The facility would get power via a hydroelectric dam, that runs off of water flowing down the ravine
- The facility would be roughly belmont sized (as far as like walkable space) with 2-3 levels, varying from claustrophobic hallways located inside the mountain to catwalks going across and parallel to the river
- Would be a few places of interest, like a shooting range, power station, military storage, civilian housing and cafeterias and shit, maybe even a helipad on top of the facility

    Reworked raid xp calculation

- The server keeps track of player's xp and money they accumulate in the raid (from looting, kills, etc) and doesn't give it to them instantly
- Different ways of leaving affects the amount of xp and money you get
- Like using an extract could give you 100% of xp and money, but dying might only give you 50%
- Maybe different extracts could multiply it more, like 120% for a non-guranteed extract or something

    Rust / Stalker type inventory system

- Split up into two part that items can be transferred between:
    "Rig", has a fixed amount of slots for specific things, such as guns, grenades, melee, meds, etc
    Backpack, stores loot in a fixed grid, and contents can't be keybinded or whatever (Also used for selling / stashing)

- Because both parts are (currently) fixed in size, a byte could store each item's place in the inventory (supporting up to 256 different slots)
