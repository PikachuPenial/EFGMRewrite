-- TODO --

Right Now:

    Rework inventory
        - Stash: Grid of slots, can be upgraded if need be
        - Shop: Grid of slots, unlimited stack size
        - Inventory: Main slots (primary, secondary, etc) with different blacklists (knifes only in knife slot, etc), and backpack with grid of slots
        - Items: All are 1x1 (more like rust / minecraft than tarkov / stalker), each with manually defined information (stack size, weapon type, etc) or defaults

Planned Eventually:

    Keybind customization menu
    Display to player extracting the time before extract (maybe global float)
    Give the titanmod discord an update on efgm rewrite development (i fucking love pr)
    (Maybe) make a universal transaction framework (would help if tradeups or player trading were added)
    Port belmont and customs to rewrite
    Finish shop UI (ive given up for now, i really need to figure this shit out)
    Post-raid screen
    Stash UI
    Smart Spawnz
    Proper extract list menu (like tarky <3)
    Team system
    Contracts (per-map missions)
    Nice looking HUD
    Translation / localization system
    Feedback feature
    - In raid, press a keybind to queue up a feedback submission
    - When you extract or die, your queued submissions come up with info like the coords, the map, and the raid time
    - You can write a description, include info like type of feedback, is it good or bad, coords, and stuff like that
    - Reports get kept in an sql table so eventually the devs may get to see your report about a small corner of a new map being textured wrong
    - Notifications if a dev fixes your report for idk positive feedback
    Achievements (all time)
    Custom banners / tags

-- MAPS TODO -- 

Planned Eventually:

    Ravine - Right now, the map is really shit, and I don't remember adding anything helping.
    Because it could just be fundamentally shit, I could try spending like an hour making 2 or 3 other layouts, and just fucking around with them.
    I'll probably do that actually, it sounds more fun than sleeping tbh

    Concrete - Just fuck off with it.
    I'm ready to just admit that I don't know how to make a bad map better, and nothing I do to concrete is gonna improve it.
    In future though, I should probably just try to come up with an actually good idea and just execute it to the best of my ability,
    instead of copy pasting a bunch of buildings and making that playable
