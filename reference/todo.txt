-- TODO --

Right Now:

    Build a framework for defining items, such as their weight, type, etc.
        - Each item should have its own information
        - Information should be easily pulled
        - Information will not be instantiated with items

    Rework item instantiation:
        - Items will be tables with {identifier, count, metadata} keys
        - Identifier is used to pull item information from the json, count is self explanitory, metadata is used for attatchments and the like

    Rework containers / inventories:
        - Containers may be organized like {contents, metadata} like before
        - Contents might use number or letter ID's, idk
        - The metadata might allow infinite stacking or item movement restrictions to allow for the shop
        - Also I gotta make a container panel one of these days

Planned Eventually:

    (Maybe) make a universal transaction framework (would help if tradeups or player trading were added)
    Finish shop UI (ive given up for now, i really need to figure this shit out)
    Post-raid screen
    Stash UI
    Smart Spawnz
    Contracts (per-map missions)
    Translation / localization system
    Feedback feature
    - In raid, press a keybind to queue up a feedback submission
    - When you extract or die, your queued submissions come up with info like the coords, the map, and the raid time
    - You can write a description, include info like type of feedback, is it good or bad, coords, and stuff like that
    - Reports get kept in an sql table so eventually the devs may get to see your report about a small corner of a new map being textured wrong
    - Notifications if a dev fixes your report for idk positive feedback
    Achievements (all time)
    Custom banners / tags

-- MAPS TODO -- 

Planned Eventually:

    UPDATE AS OF 12/4/2024 BY PENIAL: portanator still consistently updates concrete despite my pleads to do literally anything else with the gamemode, map is still shit, maybe map won't be shit for long, i don't fucking know

    UPDATE AS OF 12/23/2024 BY PORTANATOR: penial still consistently pleads with me to do literally anything but work on concrete. i think he's trying to subtly suggest that i should work on the inventory system, idk tho
