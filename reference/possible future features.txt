Features that sound cool and are doable idk

Separate day and night maps

- self explanatory
- every 1 or maybe 2 matches, time gets switched (go from playing on day maps to night maps or vice versa)

Hardcore raids (assuming voting system will be changed to only featuring 2-3 maps to play on)

- 15-20% chance one map that can be voted on will be marked as "Hardcore"

- Differences between normal raids:
- Raid time is cut in half (maybe even less)
- Loot has twice the chance to spawn, and loot table is better
- No free gun or equipment
- "Free" extracts (extracts that don't have to be activated) are disabled
- Raid interface will have an output if the raid is hardcore, so the map may change in other ways (imagine a labs map where in hardcore mode a ton of garage doors start shut, leading to a few intense chokepoints around the map where players fight to move between sections)
- Maybe disable extracts (and the way to them) for the first half or third of a raid, leading to fucking stacked loot goblins duking it out before they can leave

Im fucking tired im going to bed

- Kill yourself
